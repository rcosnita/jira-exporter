JIRA Agile Exporter
===================

JIRA exporter is a tool I created for helping me with a SCRUM project. At that moment I needed an exporter that was able to
extract user stories from Sprints / Product backlog for SCRUM ceremonies. More over I also used this tool to extract a complete
backlog that was used for Affinity Estimations.

Supported formats
-----------------

Currently there are two supported formats in Jira exporter:

   * BULK - a format which only extracts the user story information (without any attachment).
   * SUSIE - a format which extracts full details about the user stories as well as information about the story theme.

Getting started
---------------

1. git clone git://github.com/rcosnita/jira-exporter.git
2. cd jira-exporter
3. mvn clean install
4. For susie format execute: java -jar target/jira-exports-scrum-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --format bulk --username [your jira username] --password [your jira password] --startat 0 --maxresults 1000 --query "[your jira jql you want to execute]"
5. For bulk format execute: java -jar target/jira-exports-scrum-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --format susie --username [your jira username] --password [your jira password] --startat 0 --maxresults 1000 --workproject '[your jira project id]' --version '[your jira version]'

Be aware that for susie document you need a structure like the following:

   1. Group user stories within themes. 
   2. Assign a label to each user story with the following format: epic_<you_project_id>_<theme_number>
   3. Schedule user stories for a version (ex: Sprint 1).
   4. Into the assigned version create a card of type information where you describe the sprint goal.
   5. This is it.

Samples

Directly in the source code you can find two samples that shows the output of the jira exporter:
